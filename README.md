facts-twitter
=============

A simple program that pulls a random fact from a Facts installation, and pushes it to Twitter. Provides an easy way to program a schedule for these pushes. See a sample of the running application at [@factsproject](http://twitter.com/factsproject).

Setup
-----

Create a custom configuration file by copying the example:

    cp config/app.rb.example config/app.rb

Go to https://dev.twitter.com/ and register a new application. Get an application key and secret and add them to `app.rb` as `consumer_key` and `consumer_secret` respectively.

Install dependencies through Bundler:

    bundle install

Run setup:

    bin/facts-oauth-setup
    
Go to the provided Twitter URL. Sign in as the account you want tweets posted to, authorize the application when prompted, and copy the resulting PIN code. Paste the PIN to the waiting `twitter-oauth-setup`. Get the OAuth token and secret that it prints, and copy them to `app.rb` as `oauth_token` and `oauth_token_secret` respectively.

Now, pull down a random fact and post it to Twitter:

    bin/facts-twitter

Cron
----

You may want to have facts-twitter tweet periodically. One way to achieve this is through cron:

Install the Whenever gem:

    gem install whenever

Modify the schedule configuration in `config/schedule.rb` to your liking.

Run Whenever to get the corresponding Cron configuration:

    whenever

Add the printed configuration to your crontab using `crontab -e`.
